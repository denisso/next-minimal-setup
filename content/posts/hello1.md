Lush green slowly turning into yellows, reds, and browns in the Northern hemisphere; nature awakening from its slumber in the Southern part of the world: September is a time of change. A chance to leave old habits behind and embrace the beginning of something new. And, well, sometimes it only takes a small change in routines to spark fresh inspiration and, who knows, maybe even great ideas.
